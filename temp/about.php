<p>If you'd like to read more about us, we've written some short snippets <a href="content.php?page=about">here</a>. It's just a few details on each of us for those of you who would like to catch up on the basic details of our lives. Alas, that's likely to be many of you since we act like hermits sometimes. We guarantee that it will be an enthralling(ish) read.</p>
